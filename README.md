# Restaurant-Reviews-App

Restaurant Reviews App is the 5th Udacity Project in the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. In the project we convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application and also convert to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.

# Development Strategy

1. Get a MapBox API key
2. Get the map on the screen
3. Convert the provided site to use a responsive design
4. Implement accessibility features in the site HTML
5. Add a ServiceWorker script

# Requirements

- Make the provided site fully responsive. All of the page elements should be usable and visible in any viewport, including desktop, tablet, and mobile displays. Images shouldn't overlap, and page elements should wrap when the viewport is too small to display them side by side.
- Make the site accessible. Using what you've learned about web accessibility, ensure that alt attributes are present and descriptive for images. Add screen-reader-only attributes when appropriate to add useful supplementary text. Use semantic markup where possible, and aria attributes when semantic markup is not feasible.
- Cache the static site for offline use. Using Cache API and a ServiceWorker, cache the data for the website so that any page (including images) that has been visited is accessible offline.
